Repository contain scenario que &amp; ans for Aws &amp; Devops infrastructure
Here are three AWS and DevOps scenario case studies that you can practice:

### 1. **Scaling a Web Application with Auto Scaling and Load Balancer**
   **Scenario:**
   You have a web application running on AWS EC2 instances, and you need to ensure it can scale automatically based on demand. The application needs to handle spikes in traffic during peak hours and reduce resources during off-peak times to save costs. You are also required to set up a Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

   **Tasks:**
   - Set up an Auto Scaling group for your EC2 instances to automatically increase or decrease capacity based on traffic demand (using CloudWatch Alarms).
   - Configure an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic evenly across your instances.
   - Use EC2 Launch Templates to standardize the configuration of new instances.
   - Configure monitoring and alerts with CloudWatch to trigger scaling events and maintain health checks for your instances.
   - Implement cost management by ensuring that scaling policies are cost-effective.

   **Learning Outcome:**
   You will learn how to configure Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and cost-effective resource management in AWS.

### 2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline for Microservices**
   **Scenario:**
   You are tasked with implementing a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices architecture. The application consists of multiple microservices hosted in containers (using Amazon ECS or EKS), and you need to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying them using AWS services.

   **Tasks:**
   - Set up an AWS CodePipeline that integrates with AWS CodeCommit (or GitHub) as the source repository.
   - Use AWS CodeBuild to automate the build and test process for the microservices.
   - Set up AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store Docker images for each microservice.
   - Configure Amazon ECS or EKS to deploy the microservices from ECR.
   - Set up integration testing after each deployment in the pipeline and monitor deployment success/failure.
   - Implement notifications for successful and failed pipeline executions using SNS or CloudWatch.

   **Learning Outcome:**
   You will gain experience in setting up a CI/CD pipeline with containerized applications in AWS, enabling automated builds, tests, and deployments.

### 3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform for AWS**
   **Scenario:**
   You need to set up a complete cloud infrastructure for a web application using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in AWS. The infrastructure should include VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, and RDS instances. Your task is to use Terraform to define the infrastructure as code and automate the provisioning process.

   **Tasks:**
   - Write Terraform configuration files to define the network infrastructure (VPC, subnets, and security groups).
   - Use Terraform to provision EC2 instances and an RDS database instance with automated backups.
   - Set up Terraform to handle dependencies between resources (e.g., EC2 instances depend on the security group being created first).
   - Use Terraform modules to make the code reusable and maintainable.
   - Configure Terraform to manage the state of the infrastructure and use remote backends like S3 to store the Terraform state files.
   - Implement version control for your Terraform configurations and make changes to the infrastructure without manual intervention.

   **Learning Outcome:**
   You will learn how to automate the infrastructure deployment process using Terraform and understand the principles of Infrastructure as Code in AWS.

These scenarios give you hands-on experience with real-world AWS and DevOps practices like auto-scaling, CI/CD, and IaC. You can implement and test these workflows to improve your skills!
